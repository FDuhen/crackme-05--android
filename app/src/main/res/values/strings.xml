            Congrats !!!\n\n

        <br>
            As you can see, it is very easy to edit and recompile an app after editing a value as simple as a Boolean\n\n<br />
        </br>
        <br>
        In order to avoid this kind of weakness in your code :\n<br />
        - Activate Proguard<br />\n
        - Don\'t use variable names which are too explicits\n<br />
        - Multiply the checks (check a boolean in the data model, and also a hash linked to the user\'s transaction for example)\n<br />
        - If it\'s possible, manage all the premium features of your app on the server-side
